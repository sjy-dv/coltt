We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..","distance":38.556973},{"review":"The most f/p of all businesses I've seen.","distance":38.56137},{"review":"The prices are reasonable; the employees are concerned and polite; the flavors are good.","distance":38.562164}],"latency":"latency: 0 ms"},{"base_review":"Where is a good restaurant to go to with family?","similar_review":[{"review":"Nice and beautiful place.

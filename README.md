# NNV (No-Named.V)

NNV (No-Named.V) is a production vector database project by a developer aspiring to gain recognition. Internally, it supports FLAT and HNSW indexing, as well as bitmap-based indexing, with quantization available for vector indexes.

Additionally, its flexible and innovative cluster architecture presents a new vision.

## Features

When planning this project, I gave it a lot of thought.

When setting up the cluster environment, it's natural for most developers to choose the RAFT algorithm, as I had always done before. The reason being that it's a proven approach used by successful projects.

However, I began to wonder: isn't it a bit complex? RAFT increases read availability but decreases write availability. So, how would I solve this if multi-write becomes necessary in the long run?

Given the nature of vector databases, I assumed that most services would be structured around batch jobs rather than real-time writing. But does that mean I can just skip addressing the issue? I didn't think so. However, building a multi-leader setup on top of RAFT using something like gossip felt extremely complex and difficult.

Therefore, as of today (2024-10-20), I am considering two architectural approaches.

## ARCHITECTURE

The architecture is divided into two approaches.

First, a load balancer is placed at the front, supporting both sharding and integration of the data. The internal database exists in a pure state.

| ![architecture1](./examples/assets/arch1.png) | ![architecture2](./examples/assets/arch2.png) |
| :-------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
|                Architecture 1                 |                Architecture 2                 |

The replication load balancer waits for all databases to successfully complete writes before committing or rolling back, while the shard load balancer distributes the load evenly across the shard databases to ensure similar storage capacities.

The key difference is that replication can slow down write operations but provides faster read performance in the medium to long term compared to the shard load balancer. On the other hand, the shard approach offers faster write speeds because it only commits to a specific shard, but reading requires gathering data from all shards, which is slower initially but could become faster than replication as the dataset grows.

Therefore, for managing large volumes of data, the shard balancer is slightly more recommended. However, the main point of both architectures is their simplicity in setup and management, making them as easy to handle as a typical backend server.
